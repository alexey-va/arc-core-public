# New plugin arc-core contract

Every new RusCrafting Paper or Velocity plugin carries an
`arc-core-consumer.toml` file at its repository root and runs the central
consumer verifier in CI. This turns the shared-primitives guide into an
executable architecture boundary: adding an infrastructure capability requires
the matching arc-core module and canonical API evidence, while high-signal
local reimplementations fail the build.

"Use all core modules" means **all applicable modules selected by capability**.
It does not mean putting Redis, SQL, Velocity, or AI on a plugin that has no
such boundary. Unused infrastructure increases startup, dependency, and
security surface without removing duplication.

## Start a repository

1. Copy the platform manifest from
   `templates/consumer-contract/<paper|velocity>/arc-core-consumer.toml`.
2. Pin one immutable public `core_version` across every arc-core artifact.
3. Add only the capabilities the plugin needs, before writing their adapters.
4. Run the verifier locally:

   ```bash
   python3 ../arc-core/scripts/verify_consumer_architecture.py .
   ```

5. Pin the central action to the exact arc-core release tag or commit in the
   consumer workflow; never use a floating branch:

   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/checkout@11d5960a326750d5838078e36cf38b85af677262 # v4
   - uses: alexey-va/arc-core/.github/actions/verify-consumer@<immutable-ref>
   ```

The verifier emits stable `CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ERROR rule=...` lines with a file,
line, and remediation. An agent must fix the owning boundary; deleting a
capability or hiding source from the scan is not an acceptable way to make the
gate pass.

## Baseline by platform

| Platform | Required runtime modules | Required test modules | Required composition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paper | `arc-core`, `arc-core-logging`, `arc-core-paper` | `arc-core-paper-testing` | `PaperArcRuntime`, `PaperPluginRuntime`, `ArcLogging`, health probes, `LocalizedMiniMessage`, `MockBukkitTestRuntime` |
| Velocity | `arc-core`, `arc-core-logging`, `arc-core-velocity` | none until a test capability is selected | `VelocityArcRuntime`, `PluginRuntime`, `ArcLogging`, health probes |

The baseline makes lifecycle ownership, scheduling installation, bounded health,
logging versions, localization, and deterministic platform testing
visible from the first commit. A plugin may remain small; it must not replace
the baseline with a local superclass, scheduler bag, health DTO, locale engine,
or MockBukkit singleton.

The `metrics` capability and `arc-core-metrics` module are optional. Keep the
Prometheus listener in the central ARC/ProxyARC runtimes; ordinary add-on
plugins should expose bounded health through their owning runtime instead of
opening another fixed port.

## Capability routing

| Capability | Required module/API evidence |
|---|---|
| `scheduling` | `Tasks`, `LifecycleTaskScope`, or the runtime task scope |
| `deterministic-testing` | `arc-core-testing` plus `DeterministicClock`, `ControlledExecutor`, or `FailureInjector` |
| `atomic-files` | `AtomicFileStore` |
| `coalesced-writes` | `CoalescingAsyncWriter` |
| `durable-recovery` | `DurableRecoveryWorkflow` / `DurableRecordJournal` |
| `one-time-use` | `ru.arc.onetime`, `arc-core-sql`, `MySqlOneTimeUseLedger`, and `MySqlTestService`; one shared `arc_one_time_uses` table with a feature purpose |
| `structured-debug` | `StructuredDebugLine` |
| `redis-networking` | `arc-core-redis`, `ValidatedRedisTopic` / `RedisRequestReplyChannel` / `RedisPresenceDirectory`, plus `RedisTestService` |
| `sql` | `arc-core-sql` plus `MySqlTestService` |
| `integration-testing` | `arc-core-integration-testing` and one shared test service |
| `backend-transfer` | `BackendTransfer` / `BungeeBackendTransfer` |
| `chunk-tickets` | `PaperChunkTicketRegistry`; one lifecycle-owned registry per plugin |
| `paper-audience` | `PaperAudienceEffects` plus `RecordingPaperAudienceEffects` in platform tests |
| `paper-teleport` | `PaperTeleportExecutor` plus `RecordingPaperTeleportExecutor` in platform tests |
| `scoped-teleport` | `ScopedTeleportAuthorizer` |
| `player-state` | `PaperPlayerStateService` |
| `ai` | `arc-core-ai` |

See [`shared-primitives.md`](shared-primitives.md) for the contracts callers
still own. The manifest is not a substitute for domain tests: it proves routing
and dependency consistency, not gameplay behavior.

## Rejected local mechanisms

The initial gate rejects direct platform scheduling, direct MockBukkit or
Testcontainers ownership, local Hikari pools, raw `ATOMIC_MOVE`, local
MiniMessage engines, raw Jedis pub/sub, hand-written Bungee `Connect` payloads,
and feature-local voucher/coupon/ticket/book ledgers. Add new high-confidence
rules when a reusable semantic duplicate is found in review; keep rules narrow
enough that the error identifies one canonical replacement.

If a new requirement does not fit an existing primitive, extend arc-core with
a typed policy or narrow adapter seam and tests, update
[`shared-primitives.md`](shared-primitives.md), then add the consumer
capability. Do not add an exception list that silently legalizes a second
implementation.

The plugin still owns feature vocabulary. Start with a small semantic interface
and native adapter when the operation is shaped like the feature. Promote only
the exact reusable platform mechanism or lifecycle to Core, with its matching
testing artifact when needed; do not promote locale keys, domain DTOs, or a bag
of unrelated callbacks.
